"""The five platforms as one interface, so the UI automation stays DRY.

THE POINT. There is now exactly ONE client — the published CIRISClient Kotlin/
Compose app — running on Linux, macOS, Windows, Android and iOS. It exposes the
same `TestAutomationServer` (`/screen`, `/tree`, `/click`, `/input`) on port 9091
everywhere. So a test that drives it should be written ONCE and run five times,
not written five times.

What genuinely differs between platforms is only two things:

  * TRANSPORT — how the host reaches port 9091. Desktop binds it directly;
    Android needs `adb forward 8091->9091`; iOS needs `iproxy 18091->9091`.
  * CAPTURE — grabbing pixels is an OS primitive and cannot be shared. Desktop
    uses the app's own `/screenshot` (AWT `Robot`), Android `adb screencap`,
    iOS `simctl io screenshot`.

Everything else — every click, every assertion, every screen name — is identical,
because it is the same app. This module isolates those two differences so no
scenario ever has to branch on the platform again. `federation_walk_test.py`
already carries the principle in its own words: "the walk itself is
platform-agnostic — only the transport URLs and bring-up path differ." This
generalises that from one command to all of them.

WHY `capture` TAKES A KIND. Screenshots are the first need, not the last. Both
mobile platforms already record video natively (`adb shell screenrecord`,
`simctl io recordVideo`), and a p2p-chat or video-call scenario will want it. A
`capture(kind=...)` seam absorbs that without a second mechanism appearing
somewhere else.

WHY NOT `/screenshot` EVERYWHERE. It would be the DRY-est answer and it does not
work: `TestAutomationServer` implements it with `Robot.createScreenCapture`,
which is AWT — a desktop-JVM API that does not exist on Android or iOS
(CIRISAgent#1104). The genuinely DRY fix is in-process Compose capture
(`ImageComposeScene`), which lives in the shared layer and would collapse all
three implementations below into one. That is CIRISAgent#1104's first ask, and
until it lands this seam is the honest shape.

DESKTOP CAPTURE NEEDS A DEDICATED DISPLAY. `Robot` photographs the SCREEN, not
the window, so anything overlapping lands in the image (#1104 again). On CI that
is fine — the runner has nothing else on it — but on a developer machine it must
run against a nested display (Xephyr) or it will capture whatever the human is
doing. On Linux CI there is no display at all, so the app must be wrapped in
`xvfb-run`.
