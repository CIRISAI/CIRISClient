/**
 * Android debug-bundle export — into the shared Downloads collection.
 *
 * NOT `getExternalFilesDir()`. That resolves under
 * `Android/data/<package>/files`, which scoped storage hides from ordinary file
 * managers and the system document picker on Android 11+. The UI would report
 * an absolute path as a successful "Download" that the user then cannot reach
 * without adb — the same "it said it worked" failure this whole change exists to
 * remove, one layer out.
 *
 * MediaStore rather than a share intent: this runs from screens where the app is
 * least healthy (a login that cannot exchange a token, a startup that never
 * completes), and a share sheet needs a live Activity. Writing a file needs only
 * a Context, and on Android 10+ MediaStore Downloads requires no runtime
 * permission.
