"""Guard the localization bundles against the two failure modes that have
actually shipped to production.

This replaces the old key-parity-only checker, which could not find the bug
that motivated it: when a key is dropped from *every* locale including
``en.json``, cross-locale parity still "passes" at the wrong baseline while the
UI renders the raw key (e.g. ``mobile.login_owner_hint`` shipping literally on
the Android/iOS login screen in 2.9.4/2.9.5 — CIRISAgent#240).

Three checks, two severities:

  ERROR (exit 1 — blocks commit/CI):
    1. Reference coverage. Every string-literal key passed to
       ``localizedString("…")`` / ``getString("…")`` in commonMain Kotlin MUST
       resolve in ``en.json`` (the universal fallback). A referenced-but-undefined
       key renders raw on EVERY platform. THIS is the regression guard.
    2. Mirror parity. The tracked ``en.json`` source mirrors (one per platform
       bundle) MUST carry identical flattened key sets, so a key cannot be added
       to one platform's bundle and silently dropped from another.

  WARNING (exit 0 by default; exit 1 only under --strict):
    3. Cross-language parity. Within the primary bundle, each locale file should
       carry the same keys as ``en.json``. Missing translations degrade
       gracefully (fallback to English), so this informs rather than blocks.

The supported-language list is read from the bundle ``manifest.json`` (the
source of truth per CLAUDE.md), never hardcoded.

VENDORED from CIRISAgent ``tools/dev/check_localization_sync.py`` @6083bdf. One
change: ``UI_MIRRORS`` drops the two entries that are not in this repo — the
agent's server-side prompt bundle (``ciris_engine/data/localized``, which was
never under ``client/``) and ``client/iosApp/Resources/app/localization``, which
lives inside the iOS substrate this repo deliberately does not vendor and which
the Xcode build phase regenerates anyway. Both are recorded as cross-repo
obligations in ``evidence/blocked_upstream.tsv``. Everything else — the three
checks, the two severities, every message — is unchanged. See
``client/VENDORING.md`` §5-§6.

Usage (from the repo root):
    python3 client/tools/check_localization_sync.py            # ERRORs block, warnings print
    python3 client/tools/check_localization_sync.py --strict   # warnings also block

Exit codes:
    0 - no errors (and no warnings under --strict)
    1 - reference/mirror error (or any warning under --strict)
